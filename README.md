# Trading App Simulator

A simple console app to simulate trading process, this app is made with C language implementing variouse data structures such as Single Linked List, Double Linked List, and Hash Table.
This is an assigment project when I was a Laboratory Assistant Trainee in my university, so bugs or inefficient algorithms is expected.
